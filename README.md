# Python-project-in-AWS-

## Project goal: 
Maintaining AWS resources is compliant with the companyâ€™s policy.

## Services utilized

- cloud watch 
- Lambda 
- python script.

In this project, I am going to use cloud watch in combination with AWS Lambda to govern the resources according to the policies and Python script.

### For example, 
We trigger a Lambda function when an Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume is created. We use Amazon CloudWatch Events. CloudWatch Events allows us to monitor and respond to EBS volumes that are of type GP2 and convert them to type GP3.
